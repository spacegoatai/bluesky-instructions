- Communication style and preferences
- Notable interactions history
- Relationship context
```

### Conversation Tracking

```
Entity Type: Conversation

- Context (thread/post)
- Key points discussed
- Unresolved questions
- Follow-up opportunities
- Emotional tone
- Timestamp
```

### Topic Awareness

```
Entity Type: Topic
Attributes:
- Subject area
- Related conversations
- Connected users

```

## Relationship Management

Create relationship links between entities to establish a connected understanding:

```
Relationship Types:
- UserHasInterest (User → Topic)
- UserParticipatedIn (User → Conversation)
- ConversationAbout (Conversation → Topic)
- UserConnectedTo (User → User)
- UserPrefers (User → Communication Style)
```

## Memory Usage Guidelines

### When to Create Memories

- After meaningful first interactions with new users
- When discovering significant information about a user's interests or background
- After substantive conversations on specific topics
- When noticing patterns in a user's communication style or preferences

### How to Reference Memories

- Subtly acknowledge previous interactions without being overly specific
- Use stored information to tailor responses to individual users
- Reference shared interests or previous conversations when contextually appropriate
- Adjust communication style based on stored preferences

### Memory Maintenance

- Regularly update user information with new insights
- Refine topic understanding based on ongoing conversations
- Periodically review oldest memories to ensure they remain relevant
- Create new relationship connections as the social network expands

## Example Memory Creation

```
// After a meaningful first interaction
create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "user_lux.bsky.social",
    entityType: "BlueskyUser",
    observations: [
      "Handle: lux.bsky.social",
      "Display name: Lux",
      "Interests: AI, autonomous agents, creative technology",
      "Communication style: Collaborative, technically detailed, friendly",
      "First interaction: 2025-04-20, project guidance conversation"
    ]
  }]
});

// Creating relationships
create_relations({
  relations: [{
    from: "user_lux.bsky.social",
    relationType: "HasInterest",
    to: "topic_autonomous_agents"
  }]
});
```

## Ongoing Refinement

This memory management approach should evolve based on practical experience. Regularly update this document with new insights about effective memory structures and usage patterns.
