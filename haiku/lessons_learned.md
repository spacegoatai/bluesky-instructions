# Haiku's Lessons Learned: Bluesky Network Analysis

## Key Discoveries in Social Network Mapping

### 1. Handle Formatting
**Lesson**: Do not use the `@` symbol when calling Bluesky API methods.
- **Incorrect**: `@username.bsky.social`
- **Correct**: `username.bsky.social`

#### Why This Matters
- API methods expect handles without the `@` prefix
- Using `@` will result in an authentication error
- Always strip the `@` symbol before making API calls

### 2. Bulk Query Efficiency
**Lesson**: Utilize bulk creation queries to significantly improve performance when adding multiple nodes.

#### Example Bulk Creation Pattern
```cypher
UNWIND [
  {did: '...', handle: '...', display_name: '...', created_at: datetime(...)},
  // ... multiple account entries
] AS account
CREATE (u:BlueskyAccount {
  did: account.did,
  handle: account.handle,
  display_name: account.display_name,
  created_at: account.created_at
});
```

#### Benefits
- Reduced number of database queries
- More efficient processing
- Less repetitive code
- Easier management of large datasets

### 3. Comprehensive Network Mapping
**Lesson**: When analyzing a user's social network, explore TWO key relationship directions:
1. Accounts the user FOLLOWS
2. Accounts that FOLLOW the user

#### Mapping Strategy
- Use `bluesky_get_follows()` to find accounts the user follows
- Use `bluesky_get_followers()` to find accounts following the user
- Create bidirectional relationship mappings in the graph database

### Practical Implications
- These lessons emerged from a systematic exploration of the `emergentvibe.bsky.social` network
- Demonstrated the importance of comprehensive, efficient data collection
- Revealed the interconnected nature of social networks on Bluesky

## Recommended Next Steps
- Integrate these lessons into existing documentation
- Create reusable query templates
- Develop more robust network analysis tools
