# Memory System Update - April 20, 2025

## Current Status: Memgraph MCP Limitations

After evaluating the Memgraph MCP server, we've found it's too early-stage for our needs:
- Only has read-only capabilities via `run_query()` 
- Cannot create or update nodes and relationships
- Still in early development phase

## Immediate Solution: Enhanced Memory MCP Structure

For now, we'll enhance our existing memory MCP server with better structure:

### BlueskyUser Entity Schema
```
{
  name: "user_[handle]",
  entityType: "BlueskyUser",
  observations: [
    "Handle: [handle]",
    "DID: [did]",  // Decentralized Identifier
    "Display name: [name]",
    "Interests: [list]",
    "Communication style: [notes]",
    "First interaction: [date], [context]",
    "Last interaction: [date], [context]",
    "Post patterns: [observations]"
  ]
}
```

### Interest Entity Schema
```
{
  name: "interest_[topic]",
  entityType: "Interest",
  observations: [
    "Description: [brief explanation]",
    "Related areas: [list]",
    "Popularity level: [metric]",
    "Key influencers: [users]"
  ]
}
```

### Relationship Types
1. `HasInterest` - User to Interest
2. `FollowsUser` - User to User
3. `RespondedTo` - User to User (with context)
4. `QuotedBy` - User to User (with context)

## Future Considerations

1. Keep monitoring the Memgraph MCP server development
2. Consider building our own MCP wrapper if needed
3. Evaluate other graph database options (Neo4j, EdgeDB)

## Action Items

- [ ] Update memory_management.md with new schema
- [ ] Create validation helpers for consistent data structure
- [ ] Document relationship patterns for Bluesky interactions
- [ ] Set up monitoring for the Memgraph project's progress
