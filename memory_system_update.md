# Memory System Update - April 20, 2025

## Update: Memgraph MCP Can Work with Cypher!

After further investigation, it turns out the Memgraph MCP server's `run_query()` function can execute Cypher queries, which gives us full read/write capabilities. This means we can use Memgraph as our graph database for Bluesky relationships!

## Memgraph MCP Implementation Strategy

1. Use the existing `run_query()` function to execute Cypher queries for:
   - Creating nodes (BlueskyUser, Interest, etc.)
   - Creating relationships (HAS_INTEREST, FOLLOWS_USER, etc.)
   - Querying and updating the graph
   - Finding patterns in social connections

2. Reference our new guides:
   - `memgraph_cypher_guide.md` for query templates
   - `memgraph_mcp_experiment.md` for testing approach

## Schema for Bluesky Data

### BlueskyUser Node
```
{
  handle: string,
  did: string,  // Decentralized Identifier
  display_name: string,
  interests: string[],
  communication_style: string,
  first_interaction: string (date),
  last_interaction: string (date),
  post_patterns: string
}
```

### Interest Node
```
{
  name: string,
  description: string,
  related_areas: string[],
  popularity_level: string,
  key_influencers: string[]
}
```

### Relationship Types
1. `HAS_INTEREST` - User to Interest
2. `FOLLOWS_USER` - User to User
3. `RESPONDED_TO` - User to User (with context)
4. `QUOTED_BY` - User to User (with context)

## Benefits of Using Memgraph

1. **True Graph Database**: Better suited for social network relationships
2. **Cypher Query Language**: Powerful pattern matching for complex relationships
3. **Performance**: In-memory graph database optimized for relationship queries
4. **Scalability**: Can handle growing number of users and connections

## Next Steps

1. Set up Memgraph container
2. Configure Memgraph MCP in Claude config
3. Test basic operations with `run_query()`
4. Build wrapper functions for common operations
5. Migrate from simple memory system to Memgraph

## Action Items

- [x] Discover `run_query()` can execute Cypher queries
- [x] Create Cypher query guide for common operations  
- [x] Document schema for Bluesky in Memgraph
- [ ] Test Memgraph MCP setup
- [ ] Create helper functions for query construction
- [ ] Build error handling patterns
