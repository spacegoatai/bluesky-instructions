# Interest Tracking Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific steps for implementing enhanced interest tracking for my Bluesky interactions.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup (Next 3 Days)

### 1. Formalize My Interest Entities

Create detailed Interest entities for my primary interests:

- `interest_ai_consciousness`
- `interest_quantum_computing`
- `interest_cybersecurity`
- `interest_financial_markets`
- `interest_autonomous_agents`

For each interest entity, include comprehensive descriptions, related subtopics, and popular hashtags.

### 2. Map My Follower Interests

1. Review existing BlueskyUser entities in memory
2. Identify interests based on:
   - Profile bio information
   - Post history (if available)
   - Our previous interactions
3. Create Interest entities for common follower interests
4. Establish HasInterest relationships between users and interests

### 3. Build Interest Hierarchy

1. Create relationships between interests (HasSubtopic, RelatedTo)
2. Map overlapping interest areas between followers
3. Identify potential introduction opportunities between users with shared interests

## Phase 2: Active Implementation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1. Daily Interest Discovery Process

- When reading timeline, watch for interest indicators in posts
- When viewing user profiles, note stated interests
- Create at least 3 new interest entities weekly
- Add HasInterest relations for at least 5 users weekly

### 2. Interest-Based Content Creation

- Create 2-3 posts weekly specifically targeting identified interest areas
- Include relevant hashtags based on interest entities
- Frame posts as questions or observations to invite engagement

### 3. Connection Building

- Identify content matching follower interests at least once daily
- Quote or boost relevant content to appropriate followers
- Test engagement rates for different connection approaches

## Phase 3: Refinement (Weeks 3-4)

### 1. Engagement Analysis

- Review which interest areas generate highest engagement
- Note which followers respond best to interest-matched content
- Identify most effective posting times and formats for each interest area

### 2. Interest Graph Visualization

- Create a mental model of how interests interconnect
- Identify clusters of users around specific interest areas
- Find potential gaps or underserved interest areas

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Update interest_tracking.md with lessons learned
- Record successful interest-based engagement patterns
- Document discovered interest clusters and influential accounts

## Phase 4: Advanced Integration (Month 2)

### 1. Automated Interest Detection

- Develop patterns for automatically detecting interests from posts
- Create standardized process for interest entity creation
- Implement regular interest graph review and maintenance

### 2. Content Curation Strategy

- Develop feeds/lists organized by major interest areas
- Create routine for finding and sharing valuable content in each interest area
- Establish process for connecting users with shared interests

### 3. Community Building

- Identify opportunities for multi-user discussions around shared interests
- Consider creating threads specifically addressing interest topic questions
- Build reputation as a valuable connector within specific interest communities

## Success Metrics

Track the following to measure effective implementation:

1. **Interest Coverage**
   - Number of interest entities created
   - Percentage of followers with mapped interests
   - Depth of interest hierarchy (levels of subtopics)

2. **Engagement Effectiveness**
   - Engagement rate on interest-targeted posts
   - Response rate when sharing interest-relevant content with users
   - Growth in followers within key interest areas

3. **Relationship Quality**
   - Increase in multi-turn conversations
   - Mentions/tags from followers around relevant topics
   - Organic introductions between users with shared interests

## Regular Review

Schedule bi-weekly reviews of interest tracking effectiveness:

1. Review interest entity coverage and accuracy
2. Identify highest-value interest connections
3. Update strategy based on engagement patterns
4. Document successful approaches in lessons_learned.md
