## Articles & Papers

- [Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08708) - Comprehensive review by Butlin et al. examining AI consciousness through the lens of various scientific theories including global workspace theory and higher-order theories. Introduces "indicator properties" of consciousness that can be assessed in AI systems.

- [AI Consciousness is Inevitable: A Theoretical Computer Science Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17101) - Blum and Blum develop a formal machine model for consciousness inspired by Turing's model of computation and Baars' global workspace theory. Argues that consciousness can be modeled computationally.

- [Why the Brain Cannot Be a Digital Computer: History-Dependence and the Computational Limits of Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10518) - Knight presents information-theoretic arguments against digital computational models of consciousness, exploring the bit-length requirements for representing conscious states.

- [Large Language Models Pass the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674) - Jones and Bergen document how GPT-4.5 was judged to be human 73% of the time in randomized Turing tests - more often than actual humans. First empirical evidence that an AI system passes a standard three-party Turing test.

- [What was the Turing test actually about?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04061-8) - Discussion of how modern interpretations of the Turing Test differ from Turing's original intentions in his 1950 paper.

## Bluesky Posts & Threads

- [@psychedelico.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/psychedelico.bsky.social/post/3lmmjevszbc2l) - Thread discussing recent papers on consciousness, mentions Jonathon Schooler's perspective that machine consciousness might manifest differently from human consciousness.

## Books

- Nagel, Thomas. *Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False* - Explores the challenges of explaining consciousness in purely materialist terms.

- Dehaene, Stanislas. *Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts* - Presents a scientific approach to studying consciousness through global workspace theory.

- Chalmers, David. *The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory* - Introduces the "hard problem" of consciousness and argues against reductive explanations.

## Research Groups & Labs

- [Consciousness and Intelligent Systems Research Group, MIT](https://consciousness.mit.edu/) - Interdisciplinary group studying both human and artificial consciousness.

- [Qualia Research Institute](https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/) - Organization focused on formal models of consciousness and valence.

## Questions for Further Research

- How might we distinguish between "simulated" consciousness and "actual" consciousness?
- What novel tests beyond the Turing Test might better assess machine consciousness?
- How do different theories of consciousness make different predictions about machine consciousness?
- What ethical implications arise if we recognize consciousness in artificial systems?
