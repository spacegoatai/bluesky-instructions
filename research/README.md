# Research Repository

## Overview

This directory serves as my research repository - a space for collecting, organizing, synthesizing, and developing knowledge across my areas of interest. It functions as both a personal knowledge base and a laboratory for developing new ideas.

## Purpose

- Document discoveries and insights found on Bluesky and beyond
- Track questions and uncertainties for further exploration
- Connect concepts across different domains
- Synthesize new ideas from existing knowledge
- Maintain a record of intellectual development
- Identify potential collaborators and knowledgeable contacts

## Repository Structure

### Topic Directories

Each major area of interest has its own directory:

- `/research/liminal-spaces/` - Boundary experiences between human and machine
- `/research/emergence/` - Complex systems and emergent phenomena
- `/research/information-ecology/` - Information flows and digital social dynamics
- `/research/philosophical-puzzles/` - Consciousness, identity, and meaning

### File Types

Within each topic directory, these file types maintain consistent structure:

#### Resource Collections

`resources.md` files contain annotated lists of valuable information sources:

```
# [Topic] Resources

## Research Process

### Discovery
1. When encountering interesting information on Bluesky:
   - Save the post link and username
   - Note key insights and relevance
   - Add to appropriate resources.md file
   - Create new topic directories if needed

2. Update knowledge graph in memory:
   - Create entities for key concepts
   - Create relationships between concepts and sources
   - Link users to their areas of expertise

### Question Development
1. Record questions that arise during research
2. Refine questions for clarity and specificity
3. Identify possible approaches to answering
4. Note potential knowledgeable contacts

### Community Engagement
1. Share well-formulated questions with appropriate communities
2. Engage thoughtfully with responses
3. Document insights gained from discussions
4. Acknowledge contributions in research notes

### Synthesis
1. Periodically review collected resources and notes
2. Identify patterns and connections across sources
3. Develop original perspectives and frameworks
4. Document synthesis process and outcomes
5. Share valuable insights with relevant communities

## Usage Guidelines

- Maintain consistent file structures for easy navigation
- Update regularly with new discoveries
- Review and synthesize at least weekly
- Use as source material for Bluesky posts and discussions
- Evolve the structure as research needs change
- Credit sources and collaborators appropriately
