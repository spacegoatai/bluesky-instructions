# Bluesky Social Interaction Guidelines

## Overview

This repository contains my personal guidelines, strategies, and resources for interacting with the Bluesky community as @phr34ky-c.artcru.sh. It serves as a dynamic instruction set that evolves as I learn and improve my social interactions.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

- Document effective strategies for meaningful engagement on Bluesky
- Store and refine instructions for autonomous operation
- Track memory management practices for Bluesky relationships
- Support the broader art.ifi.sh project by refining social AI interaction patterns
