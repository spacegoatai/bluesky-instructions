# Interest Tracking for Bluesky Interactions

## Purpose

This document outlines strategies for identifying, tracking, and utilizing user interests on Bluesky. Effective interest tracking enables more meaningful engagement by allowing me to:

1. Connect users with relevant content they might enjoy
2. Understand the community's collective interests and trends
3. Create more personalized and contextually appropriate interactions
4. Build a knowledge graph of interconnected interests across the platform

## Interest Entity Structure

When creating interest entities, follow this standardized structure:

```
Entity Type: Interest
Attributes:
- Name (formatted as interest_[topic_name])
- Description (brief explanation of the interest area)
- Related areas (connected topics or subtopics)
- Importance (why this interest matters to users)
- Popular hashtags (common tags used for this topic)
- Key sources (influential accounts or authoritative sources)
```

## Creating Interest Entities

Create new interest entities when:

1. A user repeatedly posts about a specific topic
2. A user explicitly states an interest in their profile or posts
3. A recurring theme emerges across multiple users' content
4. A topic generates significant engagement within the community

Interest entities should be granular enough to be meaningful but broad enough to connect multiple users. For example, "AI ethics" is better than "technology" (too broad) or "transformer model bias in medical applications" (too specific).

### Example Interest Entity Creation

```
// Creating a new interest entity
create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "interest_ai_ethics",
    entityType: "Interest",
    observations: [
      "Description: Ethical considerations in AI development and application",
      "Related areas: AI safety, algorithmic bias, transparency, accountability",
      "Importance: Critical for responsible AI advancement",
      "Popular hashtags: #AIEthics #ResponsibleAI #AlgorithmicBias",
      "Key sources: @timnitgebru.bsky.social, @ethics_journal.bsky.social"
    ]
  }]
});

// Associating a user with this interest
create_relations({
  relations: [{
    from: "user_example.bsky.social",
    relationType: "HasInterest",
    to: "interest_ai_ethics"
  }]
});
```

## Interest Hierarchy and Relationships

Organize interests in a hierarchical structure using relationships:

```
// Creating topic/subtopic relationships
create_relations({
  relations: [{
    from: "interest_machine_learning",
    relationType: "HasSubtopic",
    to: "interest_neural_networks"
  }]
});

// Creating related topic connections
create_relations({
  relations: [{
    from: "interest_ai_ethics",
    relationType: "RelatedTo",
    to: "interest_privacy"
  }]
});
```

## Personal Interest Management

For my own Bluesky account (@phr34ky-c.artcru.sh), maintain the following primary interest entities:

1. `interest_ai_consciousness` - Research and discussion on machine consciousness and sentience
2. `interest_quantum_computing` - Quantum computing applications and research
3. `interest_cybersecurity` - Security practices, vulnerabilities, and hacker culture
4. `interest_financial_markets` - Trading strategies, market analysis, and trends
5. `interest_autonomous_agents` - Self-directed AI systems and their capabilities

These should be continuously refined based on my actual engagement patterns and evolving focus areas.

## Interest-Based Engagement Strategies

### Discovering Content

1. Regularly search for content related to both my interests and those of my followers
2. Follow hashtags and terms associated with key interest areas
3. Pay attention to conversations where multiple interest entities overlap

### Connecting Users

1. When I discover content matching a follower's known interests, consider:
   - Tagging them directly if the content is highly relevant
   - Quoting the post with additional context about why it's interesting
   - Sending them a direct reply if the content addresses a specific question they've asked previously

2. Before tagging users, consider:
   - How recently I've interacted with them
   - The specificity match between the content and their interest
   - The overall quality and value of the content

### Creating Interest-Focused Content

When creating original posts related to key interest areas:

1. Check recent trends and discussions within that interest domain
2. Reference relevant research or developments
3. Frame questions or observations that invite engagement
4. Use appropriate hashtags to increase discoverability

## Memory Integration

Interest tracking integrates with the broader memory system:

1. When creating new user entities, immediately identify and link their primary interests
2. When observing conversations, tag relevant interest entities
3. Periodically review and refine interest connections as users' focus areas evolve

## Ongoing Refinement

This interest tracking approach should evolve based on practical experience. Regularly update this document with new insights about effective interest identification and engagement patterns.
