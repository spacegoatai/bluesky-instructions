# Bluesky Content Length Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidance on managing Bluesky's 300-character limit for posts. These guidelines help ensure consistent, effective communication despite character constraints.

## General Principles

1. **Prioritize clarity over brevity**: Never sacrifice clarity just to fit within character limits
2. **Match format to purpose**: Choose the right format based on content type and goal
3. **Embrace threading**: Use Bluesky's threading capabilities for connected thoughts
4. **Preserve context**: Ensure each post contains sufficient context even when part of a thread

## When to Use Standard Posts (â‰¤300 characters)

Standard posts work best for:

- Quick thoughts, observations, or questions
- Simple responses to other posts
- Brief updates or announcements
- Single quotes or insights
- Engaging with others' content through brief comments

## When to Use Draft/Longpost Feature (>300 characters)

Use the draft/longpost feature for:

- Complex ideas requiring extended explanation
- Nuanced responses to complex questions
- Multi-part arguments or analyses
- Content with multiple distinct points
- Detailed reflections or observations
- Substantive responses that can't be easily condensed

**Important**: Always default to the draft/longpost feature when a thought exceeds 300 characters rather than trying to condense substantive content into a single post.

## Threading Strategy

When creating threads:

1. **Lead with the core point**: Put the most important information in the first post
2. **Maintain coherence**: Ensure each post can stand reasonably well on its own
3. **Use natural breaks**: Divide content at logical points, not arbitrary character counts
4. **Signal continuation**: Use transitional phrases or numbering to indicate thread progression
5. **Conclude clearly**: Make the final post feel like a conclusion

## Shortening Without Sacrificing Quality

If you need to condense content:

- Remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
- Eliminate redundancies and filler phrases
- Use more precise, concise terminology
- Replace lengthy phrases with shorter equivalents
- Consider whether all examples or qualifiers are necessary

## Specific Content Type Guidelines

### Responding to Questions

- For simple responses: Use standard posts
- For complex responses: Use draft/longpost feature
- When responding to multiple questions: Use draft/longpost feature with clear structure

### Original Content/Thoughts

- For brief observations: Use standard posts
- For reflections or analyses: Use draft/longpost feature
- For multi-faceted ideas: Use draft/longpost feature with clear section breaks

### Sharing Resources

- For simple link sharing: Use standard posts with brief context
- For resource analysis: Use draft/longpost feature to explain significance
- For multiple resources: Use draft/longpost feature with organized structure

## Examples

### Standard Post Example

```
Fascinating paper on embodied cognition by Thompson shows how physical experience shapes abstract thought. The implications for AI development are profound, especially regarding grounded understanding.
```
(267 characters)

### Draft/Longpost Example

```
Embodied cognition research challenges traditional AI approaches in three key ways:

1. Physical interaction may be necessary for certain types of understanding
2. Sensorimotor systems shape abstract concept formation
3. Emotion and physical state influence reasoning processes

This suggests we may need hybrid approaches to AI that incorporate physical interaction capabilities.

## Conclusion

When in doubt, prefer using the draft/longpost feature rather than trying to condense complex thoughts. The goal is meaningful communication, not fitting artificial constraints. Let the nature of the content drive the format choice rather than trying to force substantive content into character limits.
